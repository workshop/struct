  1.3.0:
  - Spec 1.3.0 is here! Support for compile flags on source files has been added,
    along with the ability to link to static libraries on targets. You can now generate
    WatchOS targets too!
  - Spec 1.0.0 is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Make sure
    to update your spec files to the latest version!

    struct directly without RVM.
  - Improved file excludes, you can now exclude whole directories instead of just
    files.
  - Improved project naming when generating projects for variants - now no transformation
    is done on project names, so you can name your projects whatever you want.
  - The way you use struct has now changed. '--generate' becomes 'generate'. Run 'struct
    help' for the full list of commands!

  2.0.0:
  - 'Spec 2.0.0 is here! Support for defining schemes has been added, along with a
    handful of improvements to make defining your specs much simpler. For more information,
    check out the migration guide: https://git.io/vHemR'
  - Also new in Spec 2.0.0 is the ability to hook into the project generation lifecycle.
    You can now perform actions before a project is generated, and after a project
    is generated, and you're provided metadata to enable performing any pre-post processing
    on your projects. This works in both YAML/JSON and Specfile formats!
  - Spec 1.0.0 has now been removed and is no longer supported. If you're still using
    the 1.0.0 format, you can continue to use Struct 1.3.1.
  - Various internal improvements have been made to ensure that new features are much
    easier to add, without negatively affecting the stability of the software. We've
    raised our code coverage considerably to boot!
  - The Struct API exposed when using Struct as a gem has had an overhaul to make
    working with internal models and project generation methods much simpler.
  - Project migration is now much more capable, you'll notice much less complaining
    from Struct when migrating your existing Xcode projects!

  - Various bug fixes to the new Spec 2.0.0 format.
  2.1.0:
  - Spec 2.1.0 is here! This contains a few improvements for defining schemes, as
    well as introducing improved syntax in the Specfile format for declaring project
    configurations.
  - You can now declare project configurations as 'debug' or 'Debug', and 'release'
    or 'Release' without specifying the configuration type! This works across any
    spec version, so there's no migration necessary to benefit from this change. Struct
    will continue to maintain backwards compatibility for specifying the types by
    hand, however feel free to remove this declaration if you're using 'Debug' and
    'Release' in your project configuration.
